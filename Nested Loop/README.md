In C programming, a nested loop refers to a loop placed inside another loop. This creates a hierarchy where the outer loop executes completely, and for each iteration, the inner loop runs entirely as well. Nested loops are powerful tools for handling multi-dimensional data structures and performing complex, repetitive tasks.

Here's a breakdown of nested loops in C:

**Structure:**

```c
for (outer loop initialization; outer loop condition; outer loop increment/decrement) {
    for (inner loop initialization; inner loop condition; inner loop increment/decrement) {
        // code to be executed for each iteration of the inner loop
    }
    // code to be executed after each iteration of the outer loop (optional)
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The outer loop controls the overall execution. It initializes a counter variable, checks a condition to determine if it should continue, and updates the counter after each iteration.
- The inner loop is nested within the outer loop. It runs completely for each iteration of the outer loop. It has its own initialization, condition, and update mechanism.
- The code within the inner loop's body executes repeatedly until the inner loop's condition becomes false.
- Optionally, you can add code after the inner loop's body to be executed after each iteration of the outer loop.

**Common Uses:**

- **Iterating through multi-dimensional arrays:** Nested loops allow you to access and process elements in a two-dimensional array (like a table) or even higher dimensions.
- **Printing patterns:** You can use nested loops to create different patterns using characters or numbers, like stars for pyramids or numbers for multiplication tables.
- **Searching algorithms:** Nested loops can be used in algorithms like nested iteration for searching elements within a multi-dimensional data structure.

**Example: Printing a 4x4 multiplication table**

```c
for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 4; j++) {
        printf("%d * %d = %d\t", i, j, i * j);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

In this example, the outer loop iterates from 1 to 4, representing the rows of the multiplication table. For each row (i), the inner loop iterates from 1 to 4, representing the columns (j). Inside the inner loop, the product of i and j is calculated and printed.

Remember, understanding nested loops is crucial for working with complex data structures and algorithms in C programming.
