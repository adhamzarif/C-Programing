Files are a fundamental way to store and retrieve data persistently in C programs. They allow you to work with data beyond the program's execution and share information between different program runs. Here's a breakdown of file handling in C:

**File Operations:**

C provides various functions for working with files, which can be broadly categorized into the following operations:

* **Opening a file:** This establishes a connection between your program and the file on the storage device. You use the `fopen` function, specifying the file's name and a mode indicating how you want to access the file (reading, writing, appending, etc.).
* **Reading from a file:** Once a file is opened for reading, you can use functions like `fread` or `fscanf` to retrieve data from the file content.
* **Writing to a file:** With the file opened in write or append mode, you can use functions like `fwrite` or `fprintf` to store data into the file.
* **Closing a file:** It's crucial to close the file using `fclose` when you're done to release system resources and ensure data integrity.

**File Modes:**

The `fopen` function takes a second argument specifying the mode in which you want to open the file. Here are some common modes:

* `"r"`: Open for reading (existing file)
* `"w"`: Open for writing (creates a new file or overwrites an existing one)
* `"a"`: Open for appending (creates a new file or adds data to the end of an existing file)
* `"r+"`: Open for both reading and writing (existing file)
* `"w+"`: Open for both reading and writing (creates a new file or overwrites an existing one)
* `"a+"`: Open for reading and appending (creates a new file or adds data to the end of an existing file)

**Important Considerations:**

* **Error handling:**  File operations can fail due to various reasons (e.g., file not found, disk full). It's essential to check the return value of file operations (usually a pointer) to handle errors gracefully and prevent unexpected program behavior.
* **File pointers:**  C uses file pointers to keep track of the current position within a file during reading or writing operations. Functions like `fseek` and `ftell` allow you to manipulate the file pointer.

**Example: Reading Contents of a Text File**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  FILE *fptr;
  char buffer[100];

  fptr = fopen("example.txt", "r");  // Open file for reading

  if (fptr == NULL) {
    printf("Error opening file!\n");
    return 1;
  }

  while (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), fptr) != NULL) {
    printf("%s", buffer);  // Print the read line
  }

  fclose(fptr);  // Close the file
  return 0;
}
```

In this example:

* The program opens the file "example.txt" for reading.
* It uses a loop with `fgets` to read lines from the file character by character until the end of the file is reached.
* Finally, it closes the file.
