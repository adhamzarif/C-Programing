In C programming, a structure (or struct) is a user-defined data type that allows you to group variables of different data types under a single name. This creates a composite data type that represents a real-world entity or concept.

Here's a breakdown of what structures are and why they're useful:

**What are structures?**

* Imagine a struct as a blueprint or template for creating a specific kind of data record.
* This record can hold elements (or members) of different data types like integers, floats, strings, etc.
* All the members are bundled together under a single structure name, making it easier to manage related data.

**Why use structures?**

* **Grouping related data:**  Instead of having separate variables for different aspects of an entity, you can group them into a struct. For example, a `Student` struct might have members for name (string), roll number (integer), and marks (float).
* **Improved organization:**  Structures promote better code organization by keeping related data together. This makes your code more readable and easier to maintain.
* **Passing data as a unit:**  You can pass entire structures to functions, simplifying how you handle complex data.

**Structure definition:**

The `struct` keyword is used to define a structure. Here's a general format:

```c
struct [structure_tag] {
  // member definitions (data type and member name)
  int roll_number;
  float marks;
  char name[50];
};

// Structure variables
struct Student student1, student2;
```

In this example:

* `struct Student` defines a structure named `Student`.
* It has three members: `roll_number` (integer), `marks` (float), and `name` (character array to store a string).
* `student1` and `student2` are variables of type `Student`.

**Accessing members:**

You can access individual members of a structure using the dot (.) operator. For instance:

```c
student1.roll_number = 123;
strcpy(student1.name, "Alice");
```
